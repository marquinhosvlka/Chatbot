OncoKnowledge
OncoKnowledge is a Flutter application designed to provide quick answers about cancer using a backend API hosted on Google Cloud Run. The backend is built with Flask and utilizes the Gemini API to generate responses based on a text file containing relevant information about cancer.

Overview
The Flutter app uses the flutter_chat_ui library to create a user-friendly chat interface. When a user asks a question, the app sends a POST request to the backend API hosted on Google Cloud Run. The API processes the question and the content of the text file to generate an appropriate response.

Functionality
User Query: The user types a question into the app's chat interface.
Request to API: The app makes a POST request to the API hosted on Google Cloud Run.
Processing the Query: The API uses the Gemini API to generate a response based on the content of the text file.
Response: If the response is found in the content, Gemini generates it. If not, Gemini provides an evasive response, which is then adjusted by the system to better fit the chatbot's intended reply.
Requirements
Flutter SDK
Python 3.x
Flask
google.generativeai library
flutter_chat_ui library
